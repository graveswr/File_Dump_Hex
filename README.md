# File_Dump_Hex
Hex File Dumper for Windows - Written In C++ Under Embarcadero CLANG Using VCL

I wrote this program in about two hours because I couldn't find a hex dumper which I liked.  Feel free to share it under the GPL. It runs under Windows 7 or later.  The release version is for 64-bit Windows.  All of the object codes are linked, so there's no formal install.  All you have to do is to copy the executable file and run it.  The Rapid Development Environment used is the Embarcadero Seattle module.  You'll have trouble compiling this without an Embarcadero C++ compiler.  I believe that they have a trial offer for a one month evaluation if anybody is interested.
